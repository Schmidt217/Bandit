					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<p>The mission of Bandit is to provide qualified resources for low voltage and IT Partners in areas where internal service technicians are unavailable or nonexistent to assist customers. With the continual commoditization of product, service levels are even more imperative to provide value and lower attrition in the “on demand” world. The Bandit network allows Partners to utilize certified labor 24/7 and maintain the current service rate card structure. Furthermore, it provides the flexibility to comply with shorter response times that are being demanded by today’s market. Exceptional service is far too rare and Bandit is out to solve this with prompt exceptional service. Anytime. Anywhere.</p>

<!------------ CORE VALUES -------------->

<div id="core_values" class = 'section-holder core_values even-section'>
	<section class="section">
		<h2>Core Values</h2>
			<div class="core-values-container">
				<div class="row">
					<img src="/images/shield.png" alt="">
					<h3>Commitment</h3>
						<p>
							Our commitment to providing the best team members as an extension of your business is a great honor. We understand the trust required to allow us to interact with your customer and our promise is to meet that
							expectation. Everytime.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<img src="/images/comment.png" alt="">
					<h3>Accountability</h3>
						<p>
							Follow-through with a service call/project is at the core of every technician that has gone through the Bandit vetting process. Technicians are responsible for keeping up to date on the industry standards and best practices to ensure the safety of the client and ultimate satisfaction upon completion. When a technician accepts a job, it is their responsibility to see it through.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<img src="/images/hand-shake.png" alt="">
					<h3>Honesty</h3>
						<p>
							Having a team with integrity and openness builds a foundation of trust that
							subcontractors do not always
							achieve. Challenges can and do happen within a call, thus effective
							communication to reassure and
							provide options in our top
							priority... resolution.
						</p>
				</div>



				<div class="row">
					<img src="/images/thought.png" alt="">
					<h3>Expertise</h3>
						<p>
							The Bandit team Tiers allow a Partner to choose which level of expertise is needed on a call. Some situations are more critical than others, so having the flexibility to reduce cost for the customer for a quick resolution can help tremendously. Certifications, licensing documentation and work-related history is also required to advance in Tiers. So, we can guarantee Partners are being represented as well as, if not better, than a W2 employee.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<img src="/images/expert.png" alt="">
					<h3>Ownership</h3>
						<p>
							Joining the Bandit team requires that extreme ownership be part of your DNA. If we accept a job, it’s guaranteed to be resolved. Our staff has an extensive history in security, making our collective knowledge among the top. In addition, our dedication to putting your customer first is second to none. When a project is accepted, our goal is to create a unified front as problem solvers willing to do whatever it takes.
